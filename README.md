# URL Shortener
## What is it?
URL Shortener is a simple clone of the functionality one can find at services like Bit.ly.

## Where can I see it in action?
The entire development of the website can be found on [Youtube][1].

## Installation
- Either download the files or clone the repository with Git.
```sh
$ git clone --bare https://github.com/StretchProjects/url-shortener.git
```

- When you have the code side of thngs set up, you will also need to set up the database side of things.  To do this, run the setup.sql file contained in the sql/ folder from inside a SQL editor, such as [MySQL Workbench][2].
